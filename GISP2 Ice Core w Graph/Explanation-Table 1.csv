"Explanation:  These are methane measurements made in trapped air in the Holocene sections of the GISP2 and Siple Dome Ice Cores at Oregon State University between 2007 and 2009.  Measurements were made relative to the NOAA04 methane concentration scale using a working standard internally callbrated to NOAA certified air standards.  Concentrations are corrected for gravitational fractionation and solubility effects in the melt-refreeze extraction.  The time scales provided are:  GISP2:  Mees/Sowers Time Scale (ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/icecore/greenland/summit/gisp2/depthage/gisp2age.txt).  The method of construction of the Siple Dome time scale provided here is described in Brook et al., Quaternary Science Reviews, v. 24, 1333-1343, 2005. ",,,,
